An innovative project for developing an application for selling Cameroonian beverages.

### Project Description

This project aims to create an application that allows users to purchase Cameroonian beverages from various partner bars. Buyers can access a wide selection of local drinks and enjoy the convenience of purchasing directly from their mobile devices. Additionally, the app includes a mini-game that gives users the chance to multiply their virtual money, which they can then use to buy more drinks.

The project uses Flutter for the frontend, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience, while Laravel is employed on the backend to manage data and ensure transaction stability and security.
